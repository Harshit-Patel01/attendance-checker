## How It Works

1. **Schedule**: The bot runs every 30 minutes during working hours (Mon-Fri, 10 AM - 10 PM IST)
2. **Login**: Authenticates with CyberVidya using provided credentials
3. **Fetch**: Retrieves current attendance for all courses
4. **Compare**: Checks for changes in attendance since last run
5. **Notify**: Sends Telegram messages for any detected changes
6. **Store**: Saves current state in Firebase Realtime Database

## Telegram Notifications

The bot sends detailed notifications including:
- Course name
- Attendance status (Present/Absent)
- Current attendance percentage
- Number of lectures that can be skipped while maintaining 75%
- Warning if attendance falls below 75%

Example notification:
```

Attendance: 5/6 (83.33%)
‚úÖ Safe! You can skip up to 0 lecture(s) while staying ‚â•75%.
```
